As a result of this, Itachi began to feel that he needed to protect the village from anything that would threaten it, even if it meant going against his own clan. In order to do this, Itachi killed every single member of his clan, except for his younger brother Sasuke. He then went on to join the Akatsuki, where he became one of their most powerful members.
