The history of rainbow wallpaper is a long and varied one, with the earliest known examples dating back to the 16th century. Rainbow wallpaper was first introduced in England in the early 1600s. At that time, it was a simple design consisting of seven stripes of different colors. The colors were said to represent the seven days of the week. The earliest known example of rainbow wallpaper is from a London home dated 1608.\nOver the next few hundred years, rainbow wallpaper became increasingly popular, with more elaborate designs appearing in homes and public spaces across Europe and America. By the late 1800s, mass-produced versions of rainbow wallpaper were available, making it more affordable for everyone.\n","wordCount":"1908","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Vivian Wiza"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wallbazar.github.io/posts/aesthetic-pixel-wallpapers/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"wallbazar","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wallbazar.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wallbazar.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://wallbazar.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://wallbazar.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wallbazar.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://wallbazar.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://wallbazar.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Aesthetic Pixel Wallpapers - Kirokaze Vaporwave Pixelart Lofi Ilustraciones Paisagem Roleplay Auroral Psicodelicos Waneella</h1><div class=post-description>Glitch wallhaven аниме пейзажи gameboy картинки wallpaperaccess inspirationfeed vaporwave designyoutrust</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-09-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 1, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1908 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Vivian Wiza</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#pin-by--𝚂-𝙿-𝙰-𝚁-𝙺-𝙻-𝚈--on-aesthetic--pixel-art-background-aesthetic>Pin By ☼ 𝚂 𝙿 𝙰 𝚁 𝙺 𝙻 𝚈 ☼ On Aesthetic | Pixel Art Background, Aesthetic</a></li><li><a href=#aesthetic-wallpapers-pixel-art-wallpaper-phone---largest-wallpaper-portal>Aesthetic Wallpapers Pixel Art Wallpaper Phone - Largest Wallpaper Portal</a></li><li><a href=#horror-in-2021--weird-world-pictures-cool-pictures>Horror.

Rainbow wallpaper has been around for centuries and has been used to brighten up homes and businesses alike. The history of rainbow wallpaper is a long and varied one, with the earliest known examples dating back to the 16th century.
Rainbow wallpaper was first introduced in England in the early 1600s. At that time, it was a simple design consisting of seven stripes of different colors. The colors were said to represent the seven days of the week. The earliest known example of rainbow wallpaper is from a London home dated 1608.</p><p>Over the next few hundred years, rainbow wallpaper became increasingly popular, with more elaborate designs appearing in homes and public spaces across Europe and America. By the late 1800s, mass-produced versions of rainbow wallpaper were available, making it more affordable for everyone.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://wallbazar.github.io/tags/wallpaper-galleries/>Wallpaper Galleries</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://wallbazar.github.io/posts/cute-snoopy-christmas-wallpapers/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Cute Snoopy Christmas Wallpapers ~ Snoopy Peanuts Valentines Desktop Background Movie Wallpapers Resolutions Charlie Brown 3d Vs 4k</span></a>
