If the room is brightly lit, you may want to go with a brighter or more vibrant wallpaper. Conversely, if the room is relatively dark, you may want to choose a darker or more subdued wallpaper.</p></li><li><p>When applying wallpaper, it is important to adhere to the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions and avoid stretching the wallpaper when rolling it out. If applied improperly, stretching can cause wrinkles in the paper and lead to peeling and eventual loss of paint or wallpaper adhesive.</p></li><li><p>It is also important to properly clean your walls and ceilings before applying new wallpaper as any dirt or dust will likely show up on the finished product. Use a non-abrasive cleaner and allow the area to dry completely before applying the new wallpaper.</p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id=dreamy-ocean-iphone-wallpaper-collection--preppy-wallpapers--ocean>Dreamy Ocean IPhone Wallpaper Collection | Preppy Wallpapers | Ocean<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dreamy-ocean-iphone-wallpaper-collection--preppy-wallpapers--ocean>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e6/8f/e4/e68fe4fa54bdfcfc2faf6d5d960a1315.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VOjdV9mOThYG0QS5Fgj8SgHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Dreamy Ocean iPhone Wallpaper Collection | Preppy Wallpapers | Ocean"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>2022 is just around the corner, and with it comes a new year and a new opportunity to change up your wallpaper!
