Kakashi was born into a well-off family in the village of Konohagakure. His father, Sakumo Hatake, was a famous ninja who was highly respected by the villagers. When Kakashi was just four years old, his mother died from an illness. This caused his father to become depressed and he began to neglect Kakashi. As a result, Kakashi often spent time with his father&rsquo;s friends, who were also ninjas.
One day, when Kakashi was six years old, he witnessed one of his father&rsquo;s friends die in battle. This event had a profound effect on Kakashi and he vowed to never let himself become emotionally attached to anyone again.</p><p>When Kakashi was seven years old, he enrolled in the Ninja Academy.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://wallbazar.github.io/tags/wallpaper-galleries/>Wallpaper Galleries</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://wallbazar.github.io/posts/anime-wallpapers-hd-4k/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Anime Wallpapers Hd 4k - Apex Legends Explosion On Spacecraft</span></a>
