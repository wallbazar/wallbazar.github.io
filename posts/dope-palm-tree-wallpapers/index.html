American wallpaper has a history that spans more than two centuries. The earliest known American wallpaper was created in the early 18th century, and it was known as Rococo. Rococo wallpaper was characterized by its ornate designs and heavy use of gold and silver thread. Federal wallpaper followed Rococo, and it featured simple geometric designs in shades of blue, green, and gray. Victorian wallpaper is considered to be the first modern American wallpaper style. This type of wallpaper featured bold color schemes, realistic imagery, and asymmetrical textures. Modern American wallpaper is typically less ornate than traditional wallpapers from previous centuries, but it still features a variety of motifs and patterns.</p><h2 id=trippy-wallpaper-tumblr--wallpapertag>Trippy Wallpaper Tumblr ·① WallpaperTag<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#trippy-wallpaper-tumblr--wallpapertag>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://wallpapertag.com/wallpaper/middle/e/5/4/693438-download-trippy-wallpaper-tumblr-1920x1080.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.eviv3Tv7Ap0ahAlscOgdvAHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Trippy Wallpaper Tumblr ·① WallpaperTag"><p><em>Source: wallpapertag.com</em></p><blockquote><p>trippy galaxy wallpapers wallpapertag daily.</p></blockquote><p>Early life and influences
