In the early 17th century, when wallpaper was first made, very expensive silks and satins were used as the base fabric. The wealthy could afford to have their walls covered in expensive fabrics, but the less fortunate couldn&rsquo;t. So in 1662, two Dutchmen invented a way to make wallpaper using a cheaper material, wood. They cut small strips of wood and glued them together to make large sheets. Because wood is a natural material, it didn&rsquo;t require any special treatments or finishes to make it look nice. Wood wallpaper quickly became popular because it was affordable and easy to install.</p><h2 id=no-face--dark-spirit--spirited-away---live-desktop-wallpapers>No-Face / Dark Spirit / Spirited Away - Live Desktop Wallpapers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#no-face--dark-spirit--spirited-away---live-desktop-wallpapers>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://livewallpapers4free.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/thumb-87.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.lELqwXLugaAEl5qGk20sRgHaEL&pid=15.1"' alt="No-Face / Dark Spirit / Spirited Away - Live Desktop Wallpapers"><p><em>Source: livewallpapers4free.com</em></p><blockquote><p>spirited spirit.</p></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a new wallpaper for your phone or computer, why not try something different and go for a dog-themed design?
