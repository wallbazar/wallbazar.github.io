There are a few different types of stone wallpaper that can be found in the market. The most common type is paper-backed wallpaper, which uses a thin layer of paper to back the stone fabric. This type is generally less expensive than other types of stone wallpapers and is often used in bathrooms or small rooms.</p><p>Another type of stone wallpaper is vinyl wallpaper. This type uses a smooth, adhesive-backed vinyl sheet to attach the stones to the fabric.
