When shopping for wallpaper it is important to keep in mind the different aspects that will create the final look of the space. The style of the room, the colors used, and the overall feeling should all be considered when choosing a wallpaper.

Once you have an idea of the style, you can start narrowing down your choices by pattern and color.</p><p>If you want something that makes a statement, go for a bold pattern or bright color.
