In February of 2007, Tumblr was founded by David Karp. The website was created as a microblogging and social networking platform. The first thing users could do on Tumblr was customize their blog&rsquo;s theme and appearance with different colors and fonts. One month after its launch, Tumblr had 75,000 users.
By the end of 2007, Tumblr had raised $750,000 from Sequoia Capital and Union Square Ventures. In 2008, Tumblr launched its iPhone app and added features such as photo tagging, GPS location-tagging, and camera phone integration.
