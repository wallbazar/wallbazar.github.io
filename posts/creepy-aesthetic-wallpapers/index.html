To start, you&rsquo;ll need to find a design or image that you like. There are many online sources for free wallpaper, or you can create your own. Once you have your design, print it out on standard printer paper.</p><p>Next, use clear contact paper to trace the outline of the design onto the sticky side. Then, cut out the design with scissors. Be sure to leave a small border around the outside of the design.</p><p>Now that your design is cut out, it&rsquo;s time to apply it to the wall. Start by peeling off the backing of the contact paper and sticking it to the wall in the desired location.</p><h2 id=img_1761--photo-dark-aesthetic-creepy>IMG_1761 | Photo, Dark Aesthetic, Creepy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#img_1761--photo-dark-aesthetic-creepy>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/95/c0/39/95c039b6fc2a924bea0e63e63b101401.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.woR1NF5lkjx2AnU0-Ay7xAHaFX&pid=15.1"' alt="IMG_1761 | Photo, Dark aesthetic, Creepy"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Tips for Using Tumblr
