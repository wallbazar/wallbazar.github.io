Japanese wallpaper, also known as &ldquo;shikishi-e&rdquo; in Japan, refers to any decorative wallpaper used in a Japanese-style home. Western wallpaper is typically made up of rectangular or square pieces of paper that are attached to the wall using either nails or hooks. Japanese wallpapers are often composed of a variety of patterns and designs that can be quite intricate. They can also be brightly colored and lively, contrasting sharply with the more subdued tones common in Western homes.
Japanese wallpapers come in all shapes and sizes, from delicate lace patterns to bold stripes and grids. They&rsquo;re often used in conjunction with other Japanese decorations like lanterns, kimonos, and samurai swords. Unlike Western wallpaper, which is usually static and unchanging, Japanese wallpapers can be altered or updated regularly to reflect changes in the owner&rsquo;s personal style.</p><h2 id=city-wallpapers-hd--wallpapers-hightlight>City Wallpapers HD ~ Wallpapers Hightlight<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#city-wallpapers-hd--wallpapers-hightlight>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P9ciuSNtikc/UEOLdWIvJGI/AAAAAAAAAzc/IOTl4A3GAKw/s1600/city%2Bwallpapers%2Bhd%2B3.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.On-bpWXY-HGbLQhJ6OPhJgHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="City Wallpapers HD ~ Wallpapers Hightlight"><p><em>Source: wallpaperhightlight.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>How to install dual wallpaper
