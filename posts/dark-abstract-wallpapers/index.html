The history of hot wallpaper goes back to antiquity. Some of the earliest known examples are wall paintings from the Indus Valley Civilization which date back to 2500 BC. These paintings show people dancing and playing music on walls covered in a hot, sticky substance that may have been used as a wallpaper.
As civilizations developed, so did their art and decoration. Hot wallpaper began appearing in China around 1000 AD, and soon spread to other parts of the world including Europe and Japan. It was especially popular in Russia where it was often used in churches and palaces.</p><p>Hot wallpaper eventually fell out of favor in most parts of the world, but it has remained popular in Russia where it is still used today.
