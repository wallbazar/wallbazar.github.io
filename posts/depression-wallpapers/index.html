Max Wallpaper is a passionate wallpaper hanger with a love for all things patterned. Max has been hanging wallpaper for over 20 years and has never met a pattern he didn&rsquo;t like.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always loved patterns,&rdquo; says Max. &ldquo;My mom used to have this big floral wallpaper in our kitchen and I would just stare at it for hours. I was always drawn to the colors and the way the patterns interacted with each other.&rdquo;</p><p>Now, Max spends his days hanging wallpaper for clients who share his love of bold and beautiful patterns. He&rsquo;s even started collecting vintage wallpapers, which he plans to one day use in his own home.</p><p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t get enough of it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Every time I see a new pattern, I feel like I&rsquo;ve found something special.</p><h2 id=depression-mobile-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave>Depression Mobile Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#depression-mobile-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp5230603.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.__VIe9qhLU1DOI5vrzkG5wHaNL&pid=15.1"' alt="Depression Mobile Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave"><p><em>Source: wallpapercave.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>The Many Uses of Wallpaper
