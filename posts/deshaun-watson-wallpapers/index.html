Geometric patterns are becoming more popular.</p><p>Texture is also important when it comes to wallpaper. Solid colors are out, and textured wallpaper is in.

Wallpaper has been around for centuries, and its history is as interesting as the patterns and colors that exist today. Wallpaper was first used in China during the 8th century, where it was made of rice paper. It later made its way to Europe in the 14th century, where it became a popular decorative item in homes.
Wallpaper really came into its own during the 18th century, when it became a symbol of status and wealth. The most popular patterns during this time were florals and landscapes. By the 19th century, wallpaper was mass-produced and available to everyone. Today, there are endless design possibilities when it comes to wallpaper, making it a popular choice for both residential and commercial spaces.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://wallbazar.github.io/tags/wallpaper-galleries/>Wallpaper Galleries</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://wallbazar.github.io/posts/dallas-cowboys-images-wallpapers/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Dallas Cowboys Images Wallpapers ~ Cowboys Dallas Bryant Wallpapers Dez Football Sports Sprint Uniform Rush Nike Background Uniforms Cowboy 1080p Logos Nfl 1080 Star 1920</span></a>
