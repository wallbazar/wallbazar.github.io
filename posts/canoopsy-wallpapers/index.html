What is wallpaper? Wallpaper is a simple, effective way to add pattern and color to any room in your home. There are two types of wallpaper: traditional paper-backed and peel-and-stick. Paper-backed wallpaper is the most common type. It is hung using an adhesive paste, which must be activated with water before applying to the wall. Peel-and-stick wallpaper is a newer type that has an adhesive backing that does not require any activation with water. You simply peel off the backing and stick it to the wall.</p><h2 id=wallpapers--canoopsy-1>Wallpapers – Canoopsy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#wallpapers--canoopsy-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0545/3532/3837/products/Fanfave2mockupc_1440x1800.jpg?v=1617209944" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.4YKsIt3KDYDEd8gOeq_LEgHaJQ&pid=15.1"' alt="Wallpapers – Canoopsy"><p><em>Source: canoopsy.media</em></p><blockquote><p>canoopsy.</p></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to personalize your phone and make it feel more like yours, consider changing your wallpaper to a picture of your face.
