Itachi Uchiha was an international criminal and terrorist, who was also a member of the Uchiha clan. Itachi was born in the village of Konohagakure, and he later became a shinobi for the village. Itachi&rsquo;s parents died when he was young, which caused him to become distant from his fellow clan members. As a result of this, Itachi began to feel that he needed to protect the village from anything that would threaten it, even if it meant going against his own clan. In order to do this, Itachi killed every single member of his clan, except for his younger brother Sasuke. He then went on to join the Akatsuki, where he became one of their most powerful members.
Itachi was known for being a very intelligent and calculative individual.</p><h2 id=nu64-flower-summer-spring-nature-wallpaper>Nu64-flower-summer-spring-nature-wallpaper<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nu64-flower-summer-spring-nature-wallpaper>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://papers.co/wallpaper/papers.co-nu64-flower-summer-spring-nature-23-wallpaper.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.dOCgrz5VjM3sF2xJ2VoHrQHaEo&pid=15.1"' alt=nu64-flower-summer-spring-nature-wallpaper><p><em>Source: papers.co</em></p><blockquote><p>nu64.</p></blockquote><p>Step Three: Save the image as a wallpaper
